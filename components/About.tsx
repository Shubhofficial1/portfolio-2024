          I am a passionate and dedicated Computer Science Engineer with 2.8
          years of professional experience in the field of software development.
          My expertise lies primarily in frontend development, with a strong
          command of ReactJS and proficiency in the MERN (MongoDB, Express,
          React, Node.js) stack. I am excited to bring my skills and knowledge
          to new projects and continue to contribute to innovative software
          solutions.

          Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to work on a variety of
          challenging projects that have honed my technical abilities and
          collaborative spirit. Here, my journey began at Ingram, where I played
          a pivotal role in a ReactJS-based project. This experience provided me
          with a deep understanding of modern frontend technologies and
          frameworks, enabling me to craft user-centric and responsive web
          applications.
